Hi, I’m Moyosore Iyunade, a data analyst with a keen eye for deciphering complex data landscapes.
I am proficient in harnessing the power of Excel and SQL to transform raw data into meaningful narratives.
I enjoy delving into data, extracting its stories, and using visualizations to drive actionable insights.
